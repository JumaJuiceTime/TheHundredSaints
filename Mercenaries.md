Soldiers-for-hire who are typically enlisted to defend a stronghold. They will perform other military duties in a [[Designing a Wilderness|wilderness setting]], such as driving away monsters from surrounding lands, fighting other armies, and so on. Mercenaries will not accompany characters on adventures.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as [[retainers]] and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.

== Locating Mercenaries ==

Mercenaries can be located by posting notices. The response will depend on the availability of suitable troops in the area and the offer made.

== Wages ==

'''Outside of wartime:''' As listed below.

'''During wartime:''' All wages are doubled.

== Upkeep ==

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear. Most mercenaries already have [[Weapons And Armour|weapons and armour]] when hired, though their employer may give them additional gear. Note that armourers are required to repair mercenaries’ armour and weapons (see '''''[[Specialists]]''''').
