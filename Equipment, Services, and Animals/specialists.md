All types of characters that PCs may wish to hire for non-combat and non-adventuring purposes (i.e. not [[mercenaries]] or [[retainers]]) are termed '''''specialists'''''.

Note that as specialists are hired to perform non-adventuring services, they are not treated as retainers. Unlike retainers, there is no limit on the number of specialists a character may employ.

The most common types of specialists are described, along with their usual monthly wage. The [[The Referee’s Role|referee]] may add new types of specialists as desired.

== Locating Specialists ==

Specialists can be located by posting notices or inquiring at suitable guilds. The response will depend on the availability of suitable specialists in the area and the offer made.

== Wages and Upkeep ==

The monthly rate of pay includes food and basic gear.

== Alchemist ==

'''Recreating potions:''' Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see '''''[[Magical Research]]''''').

'''Researching potions:''' An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.

== Animal Trainer ==

Trainers are required for exotic creatures or for larger numbers of common animals (e.g. dogs, [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s).

'''Speciality:''' Each animal trainer specialises in a single type of animal.

'''Number of animals:''' A trainer can work with up to 6 animals at a time.

'''Time required:''' The referee decides the time required to train an animal, depending on the difficulty of the training and the animal’s intelligence. Learning the first new behaviour or trick typically takes at least one month. Subsequent behaviours take at least 2 weeks each.

'''Interruptions:''' Training of all desired behaviours must occur back to back. If interrupted, the animal becomes unable to learn further behaviours.

== Armourer ==

'''Producing [[Weapons And Armour|weapons and armour]]:''' An armourer can produce 5 weapons, 3 shields, or 1 suit of armour per month.

'''Maintaining mercenaries’ gear:''' A dedicated armourer is required per 50 troops.

'''Assistants:''' An armourer’s output (either in terms of arms produced or troops maintained) may be doubled by hiring two '''''assistant armourers''''' and one '''''blacksmith'''''. If four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired, the armourer’s output may be quadrupled. An armourer cannot coordinate more assistants than this.

== Assistant Armourer ==

Apprentices who may work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See '''''[[#Armourer]]'''''.

== Blacksmith ==

Craftsmen trained in the art of forging metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work under an armourer to increase the rate of production. See '''''[[#Armourer]]'''''.

== Engineer==

Engineers are experts in the planning and management of construction projects, for example building strongholds (see '''''[[Construction]]''''').

'''Number required:''' One engineer is needed per 100,000gp cost of the project.

'''Specialty:''' Certain races may have special expertise (e.g. a [[Dwarf (Monster)|dwarf]] engineer may specialise in subterranean construction).

== Navigator ==

Experts in navigating the high seas. A [[Water Vessels|ship]] that travels beyond sight of land becomes [[Hazards and Challenges#Losing Direction|lost]] if a navigator is not aboard. (See '''''[[Waterborne Adventuring]]'''''.)

== Oarsman ==

[[Normal Human|Normal humans]] employed to power [[Water Vessels|rowed ships]]. Not trained for combat.

== Sage ==

Sages are very rare individuals who devote their lives to the study of obscure knowledge. A sage may be consulted to answer unusual questions.

'''Time and cost:''' The referee must judge the time and cost required to research the answer to a question.

'''Chance of success:''' There is never a 100% chance of success in finding an answer.

== Sailor ==

[[Normal Human|Normal humans]] trained in the handling of [[Water Vessels|sailing ships]]. Sailors can fight to defend their ship, typically being equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armour.

== Ship’s Captain ==

A seasoned sailor, required to command a larger [[Water Vessels|ship]]. A captain is familiar with the waters around the coasts they frequent.

== Spy ==

A spy is hired to gather information about a person or group. The spy may be an outsider who tries to infiltrate or may be a traitor already connected with the person or group to be spied upon.

'''Class:''' Spies are often NPC thieves, but may be of any character class.

'''Time:''' The referee will determine the time required for the job.

'''Chance of success:''' The referee judges the chance of the mission succeeding, based on the circumstances.

'''Reliability:''' The referee may also secretly decide a chance of the spy betraying the character.
