Soldiers-for-hire who are typically enlisted to defend a stronghold. They will perform other military duties in a [[Designing a Wilderness|wilderness setting]], such as driving away monsters from surrounding lands, fighting other armies, and so on. Mercenaries will not accompany characters on adventures.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as [[retainers]] and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.
