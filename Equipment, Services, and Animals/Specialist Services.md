# Specialist Services

The DCB lists notable specialists resident in each settlement. Others may be found as noted under **Availability** for each specialist type.

**Upkeep:** The wages listed for each type of specialist include the cost of any basic materials and equipment required for their job.

**Adventuring:** Most specialists will not accompany PCs on adventures, whether in the wild woods or in dungeons. Adventurers-for-hire are described under [[Retainers]].
