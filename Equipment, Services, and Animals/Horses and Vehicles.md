===== Horses =====

==== Charger ====

War horses bred for strength and courage in battle. Adapted to short bursts of speed; not suited to long-distance riding.

**Large Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral**

Level 3 AC 12 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15 Att 2 hooves (+2, 1d6) Speed 40 Morale 9 XP 65

**Charge:** Trained to charge into melee, requiring a clear run of 40′. When charging, the horse cannot attack, but a successful lance attack by the rider inflicts double damage.

**Melee:** When in melee, both rider and horse can attack.

==== Dapple-Doff ====

Mighty, shaggy-furred draft horses, bred for their great strength. Dull-witted and easily spooked.

**Large Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral**

Level 3 AC 12 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15 Att None Speed 30 Morale 5 XP 40

==== Hop-Clopper ====

Stocky, green-maned draft horses beloved by Prigwort breweries. Get tetchy without their daily pint of ale.

**Large Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral**

Level 3 AC 12 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15 Att 2 hooves (+2, 1d4) Speed 30 Morale 7 XP 40

==== Mule ====

Stubborn horse/donkey cross-breeds used as beasts of burden. Unlike other horses, mules can be taken underground.

**Large Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral**

Level 2 AC 12 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16 Att Kick (+1, 1d4) or bite (+1, 1d3) Speed 40 Morale 8 XP 20

==== Prigwort Prancer ====

Lightly built horses adapted to run at high speed. Fond of snacking on acorns in the autumn.

**Large Animal—Animal Intelligence—Neutral**

Level 2 AC 12 HP 2d8 (9) Saves D12 R13 H14 B15 S16  Att 2 hooves (+1, 1d4) Speed 80 Morale 7 XP 20

==== Yellow-Flank ====

Tall, slender horses favoured by nobility, with flowing, silver manes and golden dappling along their sides. The haughty, laughing neigh of the yellow-flank bespeaks the breed’s rumoured fairy ancestry.

**Large Animal—Semi-Intelligent—Any Alignment**

Level 3 AC 12 HP 3d8 (13) Saves D11 R12 H13 B14 S15 Att 2 hooves (+2, 1d4) Speed 60 Morale 7 XP 40

**Alignment:** The Referee should secretly determine the Alignment of each yellow-flank, at random. After 1d3 weeks of being owned by a character of differing Alignment, the horse attempts to escape, even chewing reins and tethers.

===== Riding Horses and Overland Travel =====

Riding horses have Speed higher than 40, but can only move at this rate for short bursts (up to 1 hour). When travelling overland for long distances, parties mounted on riding horses are treated as having Speed 40 (see [[Travel]]).

===== Accessories =====

**Feed:** A sack of hay, oat grains, and the odd apple or carrot to chomp.

**Horse barding:** Armour made of leather and plates of metal. Grants a +2 bonus to Armour Class.

**Saddle and bridle:** A riding saddle is a leather seat required to mount and ride a horse. A pack saddle is necessary for horses to carry heavy loads, as it includes a rack upon which to lash crates, bags, and bundles.

**Riding saddle bags:** Hold up to 500 coins of weight.

===== Land Vehicles =====

^ Vehicle^ Cost (gp)^ AC^ HP^ Speed^ Cargo^ Animals^
| Cart| 100| 10| 1d4| 30| 10,000| 1 draft horse or 2 mules|

===== Land Vehicles =====

**Cart:** A two-wheeled vehicle. If pulled by twice as many animals (2 draft horses or 4 mules), a cart can hold up to 20,000 coins of weight.

**Wagon:** A four-wheeled, open vehicle. If pulled by twice as many animals (4 draft horses or 8 mules), a wagon can hold up to 40,000 coins of weight.

===== Water Vehicles =====

**Barge:** A flat-bottomed boat, 20′ long and 10′ wide, designed for carrying cargo. Barges may be rowed, pushed with poles, or pulled by horses on the riverbank.

**Canoe:** A small boat, 15′ long and 3′ wide, made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction (weighing 500 coins), a canoe may be carried by two people.

**Fishing boat:** A small sailing boat, 20–30′ long and 6′ wide.

**Raft:** A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some form of shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30′ × 40′. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).

**Raft, makeshift:** Given sufficient trees for wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1d3 days per 10′ square section (up to a maximum size of 20′ × 30′).

**Rowing boat:** A small wooden boat for 1–2 people, 10′ long and 4′ wide.

===== Rules For Vehicles =====

**Basic stats:** Vehicles have Armour Class, Hit Points, and Speed.

**Damaging:** Magic, area effects (e.g. flaming oil), and giant monsters’ attacks inflict 1/5 normal damage. Normal attacks (e.g. bows, claws, swords) are ineffective.

**Effects of damage:** A vehicle’s Speed is reduced by 10% for every 10% of its maximum Hit Points it loses.

**Repairs:** Crew can repair damage up to half a vehicle’s maximum Hit Points in the field. Full repairs require a workshop or dock.

**Cargo:** Lists the maximum weight of cargo (in coins) a vehicle can carry.

**Crew / animals:** Lists the number of beasts of burden, trained sailors (see [[Specialist Services]]), or untrained characters needed to operate the vehicle.

**Reduced crew:** A vehicle’s Speed is reduced by 10% for every 10% of its crew that is missing.

**Passengers:** Vehicles can carry passengers in place of cargo: one Small or Medium person per 5,000 coins of cargo space.

===== Water Travel =====

Drifting along Dolmenwood’s waterways is handled using the normal travel rules (see [[Travel]]). The Referee tracks the party’s position along the body of water as they travel. 

**Lakes:** Treat as hexes with a cost of 2 Travel Points.

**Rivers:** Treat similarly to roads, costing 2 Travel Points per 6 miles when travelling downstream (i.e. with the current) and 3 Travel Points per 6 miles when travelling upstream (i.e. against the current). On the Referee’s hex map (DCB), rivers are annotated with 6 mile marker points.

**Hex features:** The party may explore any features along the shore in hexes they pass through.

**Rest:** The vessel is assumed to be docked or anchored during rest breaks and at night.
