## Vessel Dimensions

A ship’s '''''beam''''' is its width and its '''''draft''''' is the depth it extends beneath the water.

== Historical Periods ==

The vessels described in this section span various historical periods, from the ancient period to the medieval. Not all types of vessels may be available in a campaign setting.

== Seaworthy Vessels ==

=== Descriptions ===

'''Lifeboat:''' A small boat with a mast that collapses down for storage. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the cargo capacity of the ship on which it is carried by this much. 1–2 lifeboats are usually purchased for small ships, 3–4 for larger ships. A lifeboat is usually stocked with a week’s rations for ten human-sized characters.

'''Longship:''' A narrow ship which may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fill the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters, as needed.

'''Sailing ship, large:''' A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually has multiple decks and raised “castles” at the bow and stern, providing a good vantage point for archers.

'''Sailing ship, small:''' A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.

'''Troop transport (large, small):''' Vessels similar to normal sailing ships, but adapted for the mass transportation of troops and mounts. Often include large hatches allowing horses to board.

'''Warship (large, small):''' Vessels similar to normal sailing ships, but adapted for warfare, with space for [[mercenaries]] and catapults.

== Unseaworthy Vessels ==

=== Descriptions ===

'''Boat, river:''' Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. A roof can be added to protect passengers and cargo, costing an additional 1,000gp.

'''Boat, sailing:''' A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.

'''Canoe:''' A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).

'''Galley, large:''' A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

'''Galley, small:''' A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

'''Galley, war:''' A large galley often specially constructed as a fleet’s flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.

'''Raft, makeshift:''' Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a maximum size of 20’ × 30’).

'''Raft, professional:''' A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some form of shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ × 40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).

=== Crew ===

Vessels are propelled by rowing or sailing, with some able to use either means. The necessary crew and the resulting speeds are given in the table above. The pay rates for crew are listed in '''''[[Specialists]]'''''.

=== Ship Modifications ===

The following modifications may be made to an existing ship:

* '''Warship:''' A sailing ship may be converted into a warship or troop transport of the same size. The modification costs one-third of the ship’s original cost.
* '''Catapult:''' A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship.
* '''Ram:''' A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already comes with a ram fitted).

|}

=== Rams ===

Can be used against ships or giant sea monsters. Small individuals cannot be targeted.

'''Attack rolls:''' Are made using a THAC0 of 19 [0] and occur at the same point in the combat sequence as missile fire.

'''Attack modifiers:''' May be applied for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc.

'''Large or war galley:''' Deals 1d6+5 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.

'''Small galley:''' Deals 1d4+4 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.

=== Catapults ===

Fire either large rocks or flaming pitch.

'''Weight:''' A catapult plus twenty rounds of shot weighs 10,000 coins (subtracted from the ship’s cargo allowance).

'''Range:''' 150–300 yards.

'''Attack rolls and rate of fire:''' Depend on the number of crew manning the catapult:

* '''2 crew (minimum):''' Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 10 rounds.
* '''3 crew:''' Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 8 rounds.
* '''4 crew (maximum):''' Attacks with THAC0 17 [+2]. Fires every 5 rounds.

'''Attack modifiers:''' May be applied for weather conditions, manoeuvrability, etc.

==== Catapult Shot ====

Inflicts 3d6 hull damage against ships.

==== Catapult Shot, Pitch ====

Sets a 10’×10’ area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten crew in 2 turns, or fifteen crew in 1 turn.
