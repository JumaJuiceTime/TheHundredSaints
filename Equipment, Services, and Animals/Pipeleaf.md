====== Pipeleaf ======

**Further details:** The //Dolmenwood Player's Book// provides further flavour and details of the pipeleafs characters can buy.

===== Availability =====

Lists the chance that an item is available in a settlement when sought. Leaf may be purchased from tavernkeeps or wandering pedlars specialising in the trade.

===== Smoking (Optional Rule) =====

The many pipeleafs listed in this section are assumed to simply add flavour to the campaign world, without having any specific mechanical effect. Groups that wish the smoking of pipeleaf to take on a more functional (and therefore perhaps more prominent) role in the campaign may use the following rule.

==== Quiet Contemplation ====

When vexed by a problem, a character may sit down, get out their pipe, and spend an hour smoking in quiet contemplation or in debate with companions.

If the hour passes undisturbed, the player may make an Intelligence Check. If several characters smoke and debate together, the most intelligent character makes the check, with a +1 bonus per 2 companions (maximum of +2). If the check succeeds, the Referee gives the player a clue about the problem being contemplated.
