## Weapon Qualities

**Armour piercing:** **+2 Attack** against targets wearing non-magical metal armour.

**Brace:** When attacking a target that charged into melee with the wielder this Round, inflicts **double damage** due to bracing the weapon against the ground.

**Charge:** Charge attacks from a suitable mount (see [[Horses and Vehicles]]), double any damage inflicted.

**Melee:** Close quarters weapon, only usable within **5′** of an opponent.

**Missile:** Thrown or fired weapon, only usable at greater than **5′** from an opponent. The distances for **short (+1 Attack)**, **medium**, and **long (–1 Attack)** range are shown in parentheses.

**Reach:** Can be used to attack from the second rank, from behind one or more allies in front. Incurs a **–2 Attack penalty** if the ally in front is of equal size or larger than the wielder or is using a two-handed weapon.

**Reload:** Can only be fired once every **2 Rounds**, requiring a Round to reload between shots.

**Splash:** On a successful attack, the container smashes and douses the target with the liquid. The listed damage is inflicted for **2 Rounds**, as the liquid drips off.

**Two-handed:** Requires both hands to wield. The character cannot carry anything (e.g. a shield) in the other hand.

**Special:** 

Holy water: Water blessed by high-ranking clergy, stored in a special vial for use in religious rituals. Holy water inflicts damage on undead monsters. Loses its power if transferred from the blessed vials it is stored in.

Oil flask: A flask of oil fuels a lantern for four hours (24 Turns). Burning oil can also be used as a weapon, either by throwing it at enemies (see [[Armour and Weapons#Weapons]]) or by pooling it on the ground (covers a **3′ diameter area**, burns for **1 Turn**, **1d8 Damage** to creatures passing through).


## Armour

**Light armour:** Textile armor, Subarmalis with pteryges.

**Medium armour:** Thorax(Lorica hamata, squamata, or segmentata) often accompanied by ocreae(greaves)

**Panoply:** A suit of armor including a thorax(armored tunic), manikia(armored sleeves), and ocreae(greaves)

**Kataphract:** A head to toe suit of lamellar armor. Primarily for use while on armored horseback.

**Shield:** Made of metal or reinforced wood.

**Unarmoured:** Standard clothing.

### Tailoring Armour

**Custom crafting:** If armour suited to a character’s size is not available for purchase, an armourer may be able to craft custom-fitted armour. This has no extra cost, but it takes **2d6 days**.

**Adapting armour:** An armourer can adapt an existing suit of armour to a character of different size. This process takes **2d6 days** and costs **half the armour’s full price**. For example, tailoring a suit of human-sized chainmail to fit a woodgrue would cost **20gp**.

## Weapons

**Battle axe:** A heavy axe with a **3′ haft**.

**Club:** A **2–3′** length of stout wood with a heavy head.

**Crossbow:** A bow mounted horizontally on a wooden shaft, with a winding mechanism to pull back the string and nock a quarrel. May be kept in the loaded position.

**Dagger:** A **1′ long, two-edged blade**.

**Hand axe:** A **2′ long hatchet** suitable for use in melee or for throwing.

**Lance:** A **10′ shaft** of strong wood tipped with a pointed, leaf-shaped blade. Designed for use on horseback, but may also be used on foot.

**Longbow:** A bow of around the wielder’s height, typically **6′ in length**. Fires arrows.

**Longsword:** Typically double-edged and around **3–4′ in length**.

**Mace:** A **2–3′** haft with a studded, flanged, or spiked head.

**Polearm:** A long haft (**8′ or longer**) tipped with a stabbing point or slashing blade. Many types of polearms exist, but all are treated as one weapon type for simplicity.

**Shortbow:** A bow of around **4′ in length**. Fires arrows.

**Shortsword:** **2′ blades** designed as thrusting and stabbing weapons.

**Sling:** A strap of leather or fabric used to twirl and launch normal stones at high speed.

**Spear:** A haft of strong, flexible wood, typically around **5′ long**, tipped with a stabbing metal point.

**Staff:** A stout length of wood, typically **6–8′ long**. Staves often double as walking sticks, but those designed for combat may be shod with metal end caps.

**Two-handed sword:** A great, heavy sword, **5–6′ in length**.

**War hammer:** A **2–3′** haft tipped with a heavy metal hammer head, often with a spike on one side.

### Weapons of Special Metals

Adventurers in Ouran sometimes seek out weapons forged of **cold iron** or **silver**, as those metals are harmful to fairies or certain undead monsters.

**Time:** Cold iron and silver weapons must be crafted to special order, incurring a delay of **2d6 days**.

#### Cold Iron Weapons

**Cost:** **Double** the weapon’s normal price.

**Damage:** Cold iron weapons gain a **+1 damage bonus** against fairies and demi-fey, but suffer a **–1 damage penalty** against other creatures. For example, a cold iron shortsword inflicts **1d6+1 damage** on a fairy or demi-fey (rather than the standard 1d6) and **1d6–1 damage** against other creatures.

**Construction:** Cold iron weapons are made of pure iron, forged in flames of ancient yew wood, and doused in water infused with mandrake root.

#### Silver Weapons

**Cost:** **Ten times** the weapon’s normal price.

**Damage:** Silver weapons inflict normal damage on all foes, but certain foes can only be harmed by silver (or magic) weapons.

## Using Disallowed Weapons and Armour (Optional Rule)

Characters may sometimes wish to use weapons or armour not allowed by their Kindred or Class. This may be handled as follows.

**Weapons:** **–4 penalty** to Attack Rolls.

**Armour and shields:** **–2 Armour Class penalty**. The character cannot use Kindred or Class capabilities reliant on stealth, reactions, or agility or of a magical nature (e.g. glamours, spell casting).
