====== Beverages ======

**Further details:** The //Dolmenwood Player's Book// provides further flavour and details of the beverages characters can buy.

===== Availability =====

Beverages are stocked at inns and taverns according to the quality of the establishment (see [[Food and Lodgings]]), as follows.

**Poor:** 3–4 common beverages, 1 uncommon.

**Common:** All common beverages, 3–4 uncommon.

**Fancy:** All common and uncommon beverages, 3–4 rare.

===== Inebriation (Optional Rule) =====

For each measure of an alcoholic drink consumed, make a Constitution Check. Failure indicates that the character has reached the next level of inebriation.

==== Levels of Inebriation ====

**Tipsy:** The effects noted in the beverage’s description become appreciable. The character suffers a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls.

**Drunk:** The effects noted in the beverage’s description are in full effect. The character suffers a –1 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws and gains 1d4 bonus Hit Points (these can increase the character’s current HP total above the normal maximum). Damage is subtracted first from the bonus Hit Points. Any remaining bonus Hit Points are lost once Sober.

**Groggy:** The effects noted in the beverage’s description are in full effect. The character suffers a –2 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saving Throws. Any bonus Hit Points gained at the Drunk level remain.

**Unconscious:** The character passes out.

==== Sobering Up ====

An inebriated character who ceases to drink loses one level of inebriation every 2 hours.
