# Languages

A multitude of languages, dialects, and cants are spoken, from the common tongues of mortal folk to the otherworldly intonations of Fairy. Many of these languages can be learned by Player Characters (see [[Languages#Player Character Languages]]), while others are the sole province of ancient fairies and learned sages.

## Player Character Languages

A Player Character’s native languages are determined by their Kindred. All characters speak **Koine**, and some Kindreds speak other mortal or fairy languages.

**High Intelligence:** Characters with a high Intelligence (see [[Ability Scores]]) may roll or select additional languages from the list below.

### Common Languages

| d6 | Language | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Caprice | Breggle noble tongue |
| 2–3 | Gaffe | Breggle common tongue |
| 4 | Liturgic | Pluritine Church scriptural tongue |
| 5 | Old Woldish | Ancient language |
| 6 | Sylvan | Demi-fey common tongue |

**Obscure languages:** At the Referee’s discretion, characters may learn the following more obscure languages sometimes spoken in Ouran: Boggin, Deorling, Drunic, Dwelve, High Elfish (fairies only), Merfolk, Mulch, Wyrm.

## The Common Tongue

### Koine

The language spoken by virtually all sentient creatures. Koine has many dialects, as the common tongue, that are spoken in the wider world.

## The Scriptural Tongue

### Liturgic

The holy language of the Church, used extensively in scripture and sermon. The origins of Liturgic lie in tbd, but its usage is now common throughout many lands due to the expansions of the Church. It is a purely scriptural language and is seldom spoken outside of sermons.

**Learning:** Liturgic is in common use and easily learned. Fairies and primordials, as they have no spiritual connection with the deities of mortals, cannot learn Liturgic and find its tones somewhat unpleasant.

## Fairy Tongues

### The Immortal Tongue of Fairy

The language of the most elevated denizens of the Fairy world—those ancient beings said to be older than the mortal world itself. The immortal tongue is of such primal potency that all sentient beings understand its honeyed tones. However, only under the most incredibly portentous circumstances may a mortal expect to hear this speech. The most ancient of fairy folk are little more than legend, and their language is practically mythical.

**Learning:** No mortal or lesser fairy may speak the undying tongue, and those who attempt to study its treasury of words are beset by hex and misfortune.

### High Elfish

The language of the fairy nobility (for example, the Cold Prince and his retinue) is a derivative of the Immortal Tongue of Fairy. The predilection of fairy nobles for the outlandishly baroque is reflected in the convoluted grammar and voluminous lexicon.

**Learning:** Mortal scholars view High Elfish as the most fiendishly complex language ever devised. Due to its intricacy, this tongue is virtually impossible for non-fairies to learn. Even fairies of the lower castes find it impenetrable.

### Sylvan

The common speech of the fairies and demi-fey of tbd, believed to be distantly derived from the Immortal Tongue of Fairy.

**Learning:** Sylvan is in common use and easily learned.

### Dwelve

The common speech of fairies and demi-fey that dwell in the underworld beneath Ouran, as well as those with whom they trade. Distantly related to High Elfish.

**Learning:** Dwelve is not commonly spoken by surface dwellers, but is easily learned by those with the desire.
