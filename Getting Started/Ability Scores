====== Ability Scores ======

Characters are rated in six Abilities, representing their physical and mental aptitudes. A character’s rating in each Ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game.

===== Ability Modifiers =====

High or low Ability Scores may grant a bonus or penalty associated with other rolls in the game. The Ability Modifiers table lists the Modifier associated with different Ability Scores. The effects of each Ability Score’s Modifier are described below.

==== Ability Modifiers ====

^ Ability Score^ Modifier^
| 3| –3|
| 4–5| –2|
| 6–8| –1|
| 9–12| None|
| 13–15| +1|
| 16–17| +2|
| 18| +3|

===== Ability Checks =====

The rules sometimes call for an Ability Check (see [[Core Rules#Ability Checks]]), where a character’s basic physical or mental aptitudes are tested. The situations in which each Ability Score may be tested are listed below.

===== Prime Abilities =====

Each Class has one or more Prime Abilities of special importance to its function. For example, fighters rely on Strength and magicians rely on Intelligence.

**XP modifier:** A character’s score in their Prime Ability determines a modifier applied to all Experience Points earned, as shown in the Prime Ability XP Modifiers table. 

**Multiple Prime Abilities:** For Classes with multiple Prime Abilities, the lowest score determines a character’s XP modifier. For example, a bard with 8 Dexterity and 15 Charisma would suffer a –10% penalty to XP.

==== Prime Ability XP Modifiers ====

^ Prime Ability Score^ XP Modifier^
| 3–5| –20%|
| 6–8| –10%|
| 13–15| +5%|
| 16–18| +10%|

===== Strength =====

Brawn, muscle power, and physical might.

**Melee:** The Strength Modifier is applied to Attack and Damage Rolls with melee weapons.

**Strength Checks:** Breaking down doors (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Doors]]), forcing open doors (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Doors]]), jumping (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Jumping]]), swimming in armour (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Swimming]]).

===== Intelligence =====

Learning, memory, and reasoning.

**Languages spoken:** A positive Intelligence Modifier equals the number of additional languages the character speaks. These should be chosen by the player during character creation—see [[Languages]]. A negative Intelligence Modifier has no effect on the number of languages a character speaks.

**Literacy:** Characters with Intelligence below 6 optionally can only read and write basic words and phrases.

**Intelligence Checks:** Learning a spell from a spell book (see [[Arcane Magic]]), smoking and contemplating a problem (see [[Pipeleaf]]).

===== Wisdom =====

Insight, common sense, and intuition.

**Magic Resistance:** The Wisdom Modifier determines the character’s Magic Resistance (see [[Character Statistics#Magic Resistance]]), used when rolling Saving Throws against effects of magical origin.

**Wisdom Checks:** Campfire cooking (see [[Camping]]).

===== Dexterity =====

Agility, reflexes, quickness, and balance.

**Armour Class:** The Dexterity Modifier is applied to the character’s Armour Class.

**Missile attacks:** The Dexterity Modifier is applied to Attack Rolls (but not Damage Rolls) with missile weapons.

**Dexterity Checks:** Climbing in tense or difficult circumstances (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Climbing]]).

===== Constitution =====

Health, stamina, and endurance.

**Hit Points:** The Constitution Modifier is added to the character’s Hit Points at Level 1 and every time a level is gained thereafter up to Level 10. A character always gains at least 1 Hit Point per Level, regardless of Constitution Modifier.

**Constitution Checks:** Getting a good night’s rest when camping wild (see [[Camping]]), resisting the effects of alcohol (see [[Beverages]]).

===== Charisma =====

Leadership potential, personal magnetism, and physical appearance.

**Retainers:** The Charisma Modifier is applied to the maximum number of retainers the character may employ at one time as well as their Loyalty score. See [[Retainers]].

**First impressions:** Charisma affects the reaction of potential retainers during hiring (see [[Retainers]]) and the reaction of NPCs and monsters when first encountered (see [[Encounters]]).

**Charisma Checks:** Entertaining around the campfire (see [[Camping]]), hunters establishing a connection with an animal companion (see [[Hunter]]).
