# Creating a Character

**A note on randomness:** Many character statistics are determined by rolling dice. You are encouraged to savour the fun, unexpected character concepts that emerge from interpreting these random results.

## 1. Roll Ability Scores

Roll 3d6 for each of your character’s Ability Scores in turn: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma. See [[Ability Scores]].

### Sub-Par Characters (Optional Rule)

If you roll a character with an 8 or less in every Ability Score or a 6 or lower in more than one Ability Score, you may choose to discard the character and start again.

## 2. Choose a Class

Select one of the available Classes, bearing in mind the Prime Abilities of each Class (see the Summary of Classes table).

**New players:** The fighter Class is recommended, as it has the least special traits.

### Summary of Classes

| Class | Prime Abilities | Hit Points | Combat Aptitude | Main Class Capabilities |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Klerikos | Wisdom | 1d6 | Semi-martial | Holy magic (from Level 2), holy order, turn undead |
| Fighter | Strength | 1d8 | Martial | Combat talents |
| Hiereus | Intelligence and Wisdom | 1d4 | Non-martial | Herbalism, holy magic (from Level 1), turn undead |
| Hunter | Constitution and Dexterity | 1d8 | Martial | Animal companion, alertness, tracking, missile attacks |
| Scholae Palatinae | Charisma and Strength | 1d8 | Martial | Horsemanship, monster slayer, strength of will |
| Magi | Intelligence | 1d4 | Non-martial | Arcane magic, detect magic |
| Thief | Dexterity | 1d4 | Semi-martial | Back-stab, climb, decipher script, disarm traps, pick locks |

## 3. Adjust Ability Scores

If you wish, you may raise your character’s Prime Abilities by lowering other (non-Prime) Ability Scores. For every 2 points by which an Ability Score is lowered, 1 point may be added to a Prime Ability. No Ability Score may be lowered below 9, and no Prime Ability may be raised above 13 by adjustment.

## 4. Note Ability Modifiers

Now that your character’s Ability Scores have been determined, make a note of any associated bonuses or penalties. See [[Ability Scores]].

## 5. Note Kindred and Class Traits

Record any special traits possessed by your character as a result of their Kindred and Class, including the following.

**Attack:** The advancement table for your character’s Class lists your Attack. This value indicates your character’s chance of hitting opponents in combat.

**Save Targets:** The advancement table for your character’s Class lists your Save Targets. These are the target numbers used when making Saving Throws to avoid different kinds of dangerous or detrimental effects.

**Skill Targets:** Note your character’s target numbers for Listen, Search, and Survival Skill Checks. All skills default to a target number of 6, unless your character’s Kindred or Class specifies a lower target number.

**Languages:** Your character’s native languages are listed in the Kindred description. This always includes Koine, a trade tongue, spoken by all folk in tbd. Characters with high Intelligence (see [[Ability Scores]]) may also choose additional languages from the list under [[Languages]].

## 6. Roll Hit Points

Determine your character’s Hit Points by rolling the die for the chosen Class and adding the Constitution Modifier (see [[Ability Scores]]).

**Minimum 1 HP:** Your character always starts with at least 1 Hit Point, regardless of Constitution Modifier.

### Re-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule)

If your roll for Hit Points comes up 1 or 2 (before applying the Constitution Modifier), the Referee may allow you to re-roll HP.

## 7. Roll Equipment

Your character’s starting equipment is determined by a few die rolls. Characters start play with the following.

**General items:** Common clothes. A backpack containing 2 preserved rations, a waterskin, and a tinder box. A belt pouch containing 3d6 gold pieces.

**Class items:** Weapons, armour, and special items as noted in your character’s Class.

**Adventuring items:** Choose or roll up to 4 items from the Adventuring Items table.

**Trinket:** An odd, possibly slightly magical item, rolled on the trinkets table for your character’s Kindred.

### Adventuring Items

### Buying Equipment (Optional Rule)

If you prefer to customise your character’s equipment, you may roll for gold ($3d6 \times 10\text{gp}$) and purchase armour, weapons, and equipment as desired.

## 8. Note Armour Class

Your character’s Armour Class is determined by their armour (see [[Armour and Weapons]]) plus their Dexterity Modifier (see [[Ability Scores]]). Some Kindreds and Classes also grant a bonus to AC.

**Unarmoured AC:** If your character has no armour, their AC is 10 plus their Dexterity Modifier.

## 9. Note Speed

Determine your character’s Speed based on the amount of equipment carried (see [[Encumbrance]]).

**Unencumbered Speed:** Unencumbered characters have Speed 40, an exploration rate of $120'$ per Turn, and 8 Travel Points per day when travelling overland (see [[Travel]]).

## 10. Choose Alignment

Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see [[Alignment]]) and note this on your character sheet.

**Class restrictions:** Klerikos and Hiereus may not be Chaotic.

## 11. Note Level and XP

Your character begins play at Level 1 with 0 XP.

## 13. Name and Details

Referring to the tables listed under your character’s Kindred, choose a name for your character. Optionally, select a background and any extra details. You are now ready for adventure.
