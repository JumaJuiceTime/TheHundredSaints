# Ability Scores

Characters are rated in six Abilities, representing their physical and mental aptitudes. A character’s rating in each Ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game.

## Ability Modifiers

High or low Ability Scores may grant a bonus or penalty associated with other rolls in the game. The Ability Modifiers table lists the Modifier associated with different Ability Scores. The effects of each Ability Score’s Modifier are described below.

### Ability Modifiers
