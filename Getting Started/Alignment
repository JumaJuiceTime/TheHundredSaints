====== Alignment ======

Alignments are cosmic principles that represent broad world views and modes of behaviour. All beings are categorised under one of three alignments: Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.

===== Lawful =====

Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.

On a philosophical level, Law represents the belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the universe.

===== Neutral =====

Neutral beings cooperate with others as long as it is not to their own detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated and believe in self-reliance. Beings of less than human intelligence that act purely on instinct (e.g. normal animals) are classified as Neutral.

On a philosophical level, Neutrality represents the belief in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with neither side dominant. 

===== Chaotic =====

Chaotic beings lie and use others to expedite their own ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws and violate norms, driven by the belief that the rules are as arbitrary as their own whims.

On a philosophical level, Chaos represents a belief in the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe, wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. This principle can usually be equated with evil.

===== Revealing Alignment =====

Players must inform the Referee of their characters’ Alignment, but they do not have to tell other players.

===== Role-Playing Alignment =====

Players should consider their character’s Alignment when determining their actions. The Referee may call the player’s attention to deeds that contradict the chosen Alignment. If a character repeatedly behaves in a manner contrary to their Alignment, the Referee may suggest that they change to an Alignment better fitting to their behaviour.

===== Alignment and Magic =====

In addition to its role as a broad guide to character behaviour, Alignment influences the way some magic affects characters. Some spells only affect creatures of certain Alignment (for example, the holy spell [[Mantle of Protection]]). Likewise, some magic items have special properties related to Alignment.
