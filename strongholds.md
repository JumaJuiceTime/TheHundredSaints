When PCs wish to construct [[strongholds]] or any other type of building, the following procedure should be used:

# '''Permission:''' If the land to be built on falls within the dominion of an existing ruler, permission must usually be sought. When building in uncharted wilderness, this is not required.
# '''Clear land:''' If the construction site is in the wilderness, all monsters in a 6-mile area must be killed or driven off. On a typical wilderness hex map with a scale of 6 miles per hex, this means all monster lairs in a single hex.
# '''Design:''' The player creates a plan for the stronghold and calculates the construction cost (see prices in '''''[[Structures]]''''').
# '''Review:''' The [[The Referee’s Role|referee]] should review and approve the player’s plans.
# '''Hire engineers:''' For every 100,000gp cost of the stronghold, the PC must hire one engineer (see '''''[[Specialists]]''''').
# '''Construction:''' Once the land has been cleared and construction materials delivered, construction may commence. The stronghold’s total cost determines the time required to build it: one day of [[Time, Weight, Movement|game time]] per 500gp.
# '''Prepare for settlers:''' If the PC wishes to found a dominion and attract settlers, a wider area around the stronghold should be [[Domain Management|cleared of dangers]].

== Building in Towns ==

'''Permission:''' While local rulers may allow PCs to build in a town, it is unlikely that they will grant permission for the construction of castles or fortifications.

'''Costs:''' When building in an existing town or city, the proximity of materials and labour greatly reduce the costs.

* '''Stone buildings:''' Reduced by 60%.

* '''Wooden buildings:''' Reduced by 80%.

== Maintaining Cleared Lands ==

To prevent monsters from returning to cleared lands, [[mercenaries]] may be hired to conduct patrols. Regular patrols can prevent monsters from reinhabiting the area up to 18 miles around the stronghold. In difficult terrain (e.g. jungle, swamp, mountains), a garrison must be stationed every 6 miles.

== Settlers ==

If the PC spends additional funds on improving a cleared area, settlers may be attracted to move in. For example, the character might commission the construction of inns, docks, mills, and so on. Advertising may also be necessary. The [[The Referee’s Role|referee]] will determine the costs involved and how many settlers are attracted.

== Taxation ==

If settlers move into the PC’s domain, the character will receive an income of 10gp of taxes per year from each settler.

== Descriptions ==

'''Barbican:''' Heavily fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall: two small towers, a gatehouse, and a drawbridge.

'''Bastion:''' Semi-circular tower built against a castle wall. 30’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.

'''Civilian building, stone:''' Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. Outer wall 120’ long (e.g. 30’×30’), walls 1–2’ thick.

'''Civilian building, wood:''' Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. Outer wall 120’ long (e.g. 30’×30’).

'''Drawbridge:''' Raisable wooden bridge crossing a moat. May be attached to a gatehouse. 10’ long.

'''Gatehouse:''' Fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall. Includes a portcullis. 30’×30’ base, 20’ high, walls 5’ thick.

'''Keep:''' Fortified, central building of a castle. 60’ square, 80’ high, walls 10’ thick.

'''Moat:''' Defensive ditch, often filled with water. 100’ long, 20’ wide, 10’ deep.

'''Subterranean passage:''' Typical 10’×10’×10’ dungeon passageway.

'''Tower, large:''' Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. 30’ base, 40’ high, walls 5’ thick.

'''Tower, small:''' Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. 20’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.

'''Wall, castle:''' Stone wall with battlements. 100’ long, 20’ high, 10’ thick.

== Non-Standard Dimensions ==

=== Bastions ===

Bastions of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. Use the guidelines for towers, below, and divide by two.

=== Castle Walls ===

Higher castle walls may be constructed at increased cost. A 100’ length of 30’ high wall costs 7,500gp. Every additional 10’ of height beyond this (up to a maximum of 60’ high) costs 5,000gp.

=== Towers ===

Towers of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. The cost is determined by the height of the tower and the diameter of its base (in feet).

* '''Maximum height:''' Twice the base diameter.
* '''Up to the base diameter:''' Each 10’ of height costs 200gp × the base diameter.
* '''Above the base diameter:''' Each 10’ of height costs 400gp × the base diameter.

=== Example Tower Cost Calculation ===

A 60’ high tower with a 40’ diameter base is to be constructed.

The cost will be 8,000gp (40 × 200gp) per 10’ for the first 40’ of height and 16,000gp (40 × 400gp) per 10’ for the remainder of the height.

The total cost is thus (8,000gp × 4) + (16,000gp × 2) = 64,000gp.

== Interior Features ==

The common interior features of a stronghold are listed in the table below.

=== Simple Approach ===

For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold may be increased by 25% to account for interior details, including: reinforced doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring, tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars and shutters on windows, and standard furnishings.

=== Detailed Approach ===

If the group wishes to perform more detailed calculations or if additional features are desired, the table below may be consulted.
