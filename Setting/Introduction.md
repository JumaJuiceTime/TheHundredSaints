Civilization is a pale echo of yesterday’s empire. Fragmented, its remnants carry on its legacy. Provinces each claimed by handfuls of kings. Prefectures now become empires. Its enemies seek to sit on the toppled throne. All while the heart, the city of a hundred saints, still beats. Boats sail through the canals. Clergy issue decree and prophecy. House guards assert lordly might. The land exudes a magic, but not of or for men. The darkness between man’s holdings allows foul beings to infest the land.  Scattered lords vie for power amidst this age of man. Some seek to reclaim imperial heights, others pursue glory for oneself or clan. Churches compete for men’s hearts and control. Man’s glory has waned, yet you set out in search of your own. Will you face the horrors of the dark?
