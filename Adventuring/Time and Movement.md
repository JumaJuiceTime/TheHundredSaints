====== Time and Movement ======

When exploring the untracked wilds or the depths of the underworld, time is a critical resource. Every moment wasted presents a chance for malignant creatures to note the party’s presence. As time passes, light sources in dark places dwindle, beneficial spells falter, and thirst, exhaustion, and hunger set in. Wise adventurers do not linger, making the most of every moment in perilous places.

===== Measures of Time: Rounds and Turns =====

Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game. 

**Turns:** Approximately 10 minutes of game time. There are 6 Turns in an hour. Time is measured in Turns when exploring dungeons (see [[Dungeons]]).

**Rounds:** Approximately 10 seconds of game time. There are 60 Rounds in a Turn. Time is measured in Rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see [[Encounters]] and [[Combat]]).

===== Measures of Distance: Inches, Feet, Miles =====

Distances are measured in imperial or customary US units: inches (notated with the ″ symbol), feet (notated with the ′ symbol), and miles.

**Conversions:** 1 foot = 12 inches. 1 mile = 5,280 feet.

===== Measures of Weight: Coins =====

Weight measures typically come into play only when discussing how much characters can carry (see [[Encumbrance]]). As coins are the most common form of treasure found by adventurers, all weights are measured in coins (ten coins equal one pound).

===== Tracking Time =====

When an adventure is under way, the Referee should keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world, known as game time. This is distinct from real time: what may take the players and Referee mere seconds to describe may take PCs hours or even days to complete.

**Units of time:** When characters are exploring a dungeon, the Referee tracks the number of Turns that have elapsed; when characters are exploring outdoors, the number of days elapsed is tracked.

**Judgement:** The Referee adjudicates what characters may accomplish in a given period of time.

==== Resources ====

As game time passes, the Referee should pay attention to resources that the party consumes. For example: food, water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical effects, etc.

===== Tracking Movement =====

As Player Characters explore the imagined world, the Referee should keep track of their location on a prepared map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who must rely on the Referee’s descriptions of the areas they explore.

To determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next, the Referee should refer to the characters’ Speed (see [[Character Statistics]]).

==== Party Speed ====

An adventuring party usually wants to stay together. The Speed of the party as a whole is determined by the Speed of the slowest member.

==== Encounter Movement: Speed / Round ====

During an encounter, a character’s Speed indicates the number of feet they can move each Round. This is especially relevant during combat. For example, a character with Speed 40 can move up to 40′ each Round.

==== Exploration: Speed × 3 Per Turn ====

When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon or other indoor area, characters can move up to 3 times their Speed in feet each Turn. For example, a party whose slowest member has Speed 30 can explore up to 90′ each Turn. This very slow rate of movement accounts for PCs exploring in a dark, unknown environment, moving carefully and stealthily, and mapping progress.

**In familiar areas:** When PCs are moving through previously explored areas which they have mapped, they may move at up to 10 times their Speed in feet each Turn. For example, a party whose slowest member has Speed 30 can travel through up to 300′ of familiar areas each Turn.

==== Running: Speed × 3 Per Round ====

When fleeing or pursuing enemies (see [[Encounters#Evasion]]), characters can move up to 3 times their Speed in feet each Round. For example, a party whose slowest member has Speed 30 can run up to 90′ each Round.

**Mapping:** No mapping is possible when running.

**Exhaustion:** Characters become exhausted (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Exhaustion]]) after running at this rate for 30 Rounds. The penalties for exhaustion last until characters have rested for 3 Turns.

==== Overland Travel: Speed / 5 Travel Points Per Day ====

The Referee’s map of Dolmenwood (provided in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book) is based on a hex grid, with each hex being 6 miles across. When travelling along roads or in the wilds, characters gain Travel Points each day equal to their Speed divided by 5. For example, a party whose slowest members has Speed 30 gains 6 Travel Points per day. Travel Points are expended as characters explore hexes of different terrain types. See [[Travel]] for full details on Travel Points and overland travel.

==== Using Miniatures ====

Some groups like to use miniatures along with a gridded tabletop surface to track exploration and combat.

**Play surface:** The most convenient type of surface is something on which maps can be drawn with erasable pens. The surface should be gridded for ease of tracking the movements of characters.

**Scale:** The typical scale used is 1″ on the play surface = 5′ in the game world.

**Miniatures:** Miniature figures are available to purchase from many different companies. Alternatively, simple tokens like dice or beads can be used.
