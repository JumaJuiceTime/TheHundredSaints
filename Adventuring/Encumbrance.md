# Encumbrance

In the perilous wilds, an adventurer’s equipment makes the difference between life and death. A rope can prevent falling into a deathly chasm, a burning torch can fend off wild beasts, and a humble fishing rod can provide a meal to fill hungry bellies. Characters must carefully consider the equipment they take with them when adventuring, as each person is only able to carry so much. Each item carried is at once a burden and a potential lifesaver in times of peril.

Two approaches to determine how much characters can carry are presented here: one based on tracking the total weight of items carried, the other based on tracking the number of items carried. The Referee should decide which to use, and it should be applied to all characters.

## Slot Encumbrance

This encumbrance system is based on **gear slots**, giving a simple and abstract overview of each character’s load. Each item carried occupies 0–3 gear slots—see Items in Gear Slots. Characters become slower and more burdened depending on the number of gear slots occupied.

### Equipped Items: 10 Slots

Characters have **10 slots** for **equipped items**, that is anything the character is wearing, holding, actively using, or has ready to use at short notice: armour worn, shields or weapons held, sheathed weapons, items in a belt pouch.

**Maximum load:** A character cannot carry more than **10 slots** of equipped items.

### Stowed Items: 10 Slots / Container

Sacks and backpacks each have **10 slots** for **stowed items**, that is items packed away in the container.

**Maximum load:** A character cannot carry more than a total of **16 slots** of stowed items.

**Maximum containers:** A character can wear one backpack and can carry up to two sacks, each occupying one hand. When carrying a sack, the character cannot carry a weapon, shield, lantern, or other object in that hand.

**Retrieving:** In combat, retrieving a stowed item takes **1 Round**.

### Horses and Vehicles

The number of items that mounts and vehicles can carry is calculated by dividing their coin capacity by 100 (see [[Horses and Vehicles]]). The distinction between equipped and stowed items does not apply to horses and vehicles.

### Items in Gear Slots

The Item Gear Slots table lists the number of gear slots occupied by different kinds of items.

**General items:** Unless noted otherwise, each object a character carries occupies **1 gear slot**.

**Tiny items:** Some very small items only occupy a gear slot if carried in large numbers (as judged by the Referee).

**Bundled items:** Some items are purchased and carried in bundles. A bundle occupies **1 gear slot**.

**Containers:** Containers (e.g. backpacks, sacks) only count as an item when not in use.

**Bulky items:** Large or heavy objects that require two hands to carry occupy **2 gear slots** and cannot be stowed. Very heavy or bulky objects may occupy 3 or more gear slots, as judged by the Referee.

**Clothing and armour:** Clothing does not occupy a gear slot. Light armour occupies **1 slot**, Medium armour **2**, and Heavy armour **3**. A shield occupies **1 slot**.

## Dropping Items

When characters discover large treasure hoards, they may have to drop items, abandoning adventuring gear in order to stuff their sacks with gold.

In desperate circumstances, such as when fleeing enemies, characters may choose to drop items to lighten their load. Weapons, shields, and even stuffed sacks or backpacks may be dropped to increase a character’s Speed.
