====== Travel ======

===== Travel Procedure Per Day =====

  - **Weather:** The Referee determines the day’s weather, using the tables in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book.
  - **Decide course:** The players decide on their course of travel for the day.
  - **Losing direction:** The Referee determines whether the party gets lost, depending on the terrain.
  - **Wandering monsters:** The Referee makes a check for a daytime random encounter.
  - **Description:** The Referee describes the terrain passed through and any sites of interest that the party comes across, asking players for their actions as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in [[Encounters]].
  - **End of day:** If still in the wilds, the party sets camp (see [[Camping]]). The Referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

===== Time =====

When travelling overland through Dolmenwood, game time is tracked in days.

===== Roads, Tracks, and Travelling Wild =====

Adventurers may at times follow useful pathways connecting settlements, but they often find themselves travelling in the wild woods.

**Roads:** Actively maintained roads. Parties following a road travel quickly and have no risk of getting lost.

**Tracks:** Smaller paths which are seldom frequented and sporadically maintained. Parties following a track travel quickly but have a small risk of getting lost.

**Travelling wild:** All travel off tracks and roads is classified as travelling wild. The speed of travel and chance of getting lost are determined by the type of terrain.

===== Map Hexes =====

The Referee’s map of Dolmenwood (provided in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book) is based on a hex grid, with each hex being 6 miles across. When characters travel through the Wood, the Referee tracks their progress on the hex map.

Players may also wish to keep a map of their own, making notes on hexes as they explore. A blank hex map of Dolmenwood that players can fill in as they explore can be downloaded from dolmenwood.com.

===== Movement =====

Rather than tracking the exact time spent travelling or the precise distances traversed, travel in Dolmenwood is abstracted into a simple system of daily Travel Points, representing the time taken for various travel actions. 

==== Travel Points ====

A party has Travel Points each day equal to its Speed divided by 5, as shown in the Travel Points Per Day table. Any excess Travel Points not used by the end of the day are lost.

==== Travel Points Per Day ====

^ ^   Travel Points Per Day  ^^
^ Party’s Speed^ Normal Travel^ Forced March^
| 40| 8| 12|
| 30| 6| 9|
| 20| 4| 6|
| 10| 2| 3|

**Mounted:** A mounted party has Speed 40.

**Vehicles:** A party travelling with a cart or wagon has Speed 30.

==== Normal Travel ====

A normal day of travel (whether on roads, tracks, or in the wild) is assumed to last 12 hours, with 8 hours spent travelling and 4 hours spent resting, preparing meals, eating, setting up and taking down camp, and so forth.

==== Forced March ====

A party may push itself to travel extra distance in a day, gaining a 50% increase in Travel Points (see the Travel Points Per Day table). This requires a 16 hour travel day, including 12 solid hours of travel.

**Exhaustion:** Following a forced march, characters must rest for a full day or become exhausted (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Exhaustion]]). Characters who forced march again without resting suffer cumulative exhaustion penalties (–1 per day).

==== Travelling on Roads and Tracks ====

The Referee tracks the party’s position along roads or tracks as they travel.

**Travel Point cost:** 6 miles costs 2 Travel Points, unaffected by the type of terrain or the number of hexes passed through. On the Referee’s hex map (DCB), roads and tracks are annotated with 6 mile marker points.

**Hex features:** The party may explore any features along the roadside in hexes they pass through. Features further from the road are missed.

==== Travelling Wild ====

The Referee tracks the party’s position on the hex map, noting the current hex they are in.

**Travel Point cost:** The Terrain Types table lists the cost to enter an adjacent hex, based on its terrain type.

**Hex features:** Once the party has paid the Travel Point cost to enter a hex, they may explore any non-hidden features in that hex without further expenditure of Travel Points.

**End of day:** If the party does not have sufficient Travel Points to enter an adjacent hex, the Referee should note how many Travel Points they have expended and how many must be expended the next day to enter the hex.

**Example:** A party with 2 Travel Points remaining is travelling from a farmland hex toward an adjacent hex consisting of bog (3 Travel Points to enter). The party spends the 2 Travel Points it has, nearing the edge of the bog hex but unable to enter it today due to being 1 Travel Point short. The party makes camp in the farmland hex. The following day the party need only spend 1 further Travel Point to enter the bog hex.

===== Mounts and Vehicles =====

Mounts and land vehicles provide convenient means of travelling with heavy loads, but they become inconvenient when characters are travelling wild.

==== Speed and Travel Points ====

**Mounts:** A mounted party has Speed 40 (8 Travel Points per day). While some mounts have Speed faster than 40, they can only move at this rate for short bursts.

**Land vehicles:** A party travelling with a cart or wagon has Speed 30 (6 Travel Points per day).

==== Terrain Restrictions ====

Mounts and land vehicles can travel freely along roads and tracks, but travelling wild is limited by certain terrain types. The Terrain Types table lists which types of terrain mounts and vehicles may enter, with mounts only able to be led (i.e. not ridden) in certain types of terrain.

===== Resting =====

Characters must rest for 1 day per week of travel (i.e. 6 days of travel, 1 day of rest) or become exhausted (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Exhaustion]]).

===== Searching Hexes =====

Some hexes on the Dolmenwood campaign map contain hidden features which stay unnoticed by a party simply wandering through the area. Hidden features can be found by searching a hex, requiring extra time and Travel Points.

**Travel Point cost:** The Terrain Types table lists the cost to search a hex, based on its terrain type.

**Hidden features:** Searching may reveal hidden features in a hex, if any are present. Once a hidden feature has been located, it can be found again without searching.

===== Losing Direction =====

See [[Hazards and Challenges#Losing Direction]] for more information.

**Checks:** One roll for getting lost is made each day. The Referee makes this roll at the start of the travel day. If the party is travelling along a road (no chance of getting lost), the roll for getting lost is made when they leave the road.

**Travelling wild:** The chance of getting lost depends on the terrain being explored—see the Terrain Types table.

**Following a road:** There is no chance of getting lost. 

**Following a track:** There is a 1-in-6 chance of getting lost. 

**Visibility:** In conditions of reduced visibility, such as fog or blizzards, the chance of getting lost increases by 1 (e.g. 2-in-6 becomes 3-in-6), and in darkness by 2.

**Effects of getting lost:** The effects of getting lost are described in the Dolmenwood Campaign Book.

===== Wandering Monsters =====

See [[Hazards and Challenges#Wandering Monsters]] for more information.

**Checks:** One check for wandering monsters is made each day. The Referee may make this roll either at the start of the day, halfway through the day (when the party has spent half its Travel Points), or at the end of the day.

**Chance:** The chance of an encounter depends on the type of terrain being traversed—see the Terrain Types table.

**Creature:** The Dolmenwood Campaign Book includes tables to determine the type of creatures encountered.

**Distance:** Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 30′ away. If both sides are surprised (see [[Encounters]]), this is reduced to 1d4 × 30′.
