# Travel

## Travel Procedure Per Day

  - **Weather:** The Referee determines the day’s weather, using the tables in the Ouran Campaign Book.
  - **Decide course:** The players decide on their course of travel for the day.
  - **Losing direction:** The Referee determines whether the party gets lost, depending on the terrain.
  - **Wandering monsters:** The Referee makes a check for a daytime random encounter.
  - **Description:** The Referee describes the terrain passed through and any sites of interest that the party comes across, asking players for their actions as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in [[Encounters]].
  - **End of day:** If still in the wilds, the party sets camp (see [[Camping]]). The Referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

## Time

When travelling overland through Ouran, game time is tracked in days.

## Roads, Tracks, and Travelling Wild

Adventurers may at times follow useful pathways connecting settlements, but they often find themselves travelling in the wild woods.

**Roads:** Actively maintained roads. Parties following a road travel quickly and have no risk of getting lost.

**Tracks:** Smaller paths which are seldom frequented and sporadically maintained. Parties following a track travel quickly but have a small risk of getting lost.

**Travelling wild:** All travel off tracks and roads is classified as travelling wild. The speed of travel and chance of getting lost are determined by the type of terrain.

## Map Hexes

The Referee’s map of Ouran (provided in the Ouran Campaign Book) is based on a hex grid, with each hex being 6 miles across. When characters travel through the Wood, the Referee tracks their progress on the hex map.

Players may also wish to keep a map of their own, making notes on hexes as they explore. A blank hex map of Ouran that players can fill in as they explore can be downloaded from Ouran.com.

## Movement

Rather than tracking the exact time spent travelling or the precise distances traversed, travel in Ouran is abstracted into a simple system of daily Travel Points, representing the time taken for various travel actions. 

### Normal Travel

A normal day of travel (whether on roads, tracks, or in the wild) is assumed to last 12 hours, with 8 hours spent travelling and 4 hours spent resting, preparing meals, eating, setting up and taking down camp, and so forth.

### Forced March

A party may push itself to travel extra distance in a day, gaining a 50% increase in Travel Points (see the Travel Points Per Day table). This requires a 16 hour travel day, including 12 solid hours of travel.

**Exhaustion:** Following a forced march, characters must rest for a full day or become exhausted (see [[Hazards and Challenges#Exhaustion]]). Characters who forced march again without resting suffer cumulative exhaustion penalties (–1 per day).

### Travelling Wild

The Referee tracks the party’s position on the hex map, noting the current hex they are in.

**Travel Point cost:** The Terrain Types table lists the cost to enter an adjacent hex, based on its terrain type.

**Hex features:** Once the party has paid the Travel Point cost to enter a hex, they may explore any non-hidden features in that hex without further expenditure of Travel Points.

**End of day:** If the party does not have sufficient Travel Points to enter an adjacent hex, the Referee should note how many Travel Points they have expended and how many must be expended the next day to enter the hex.

## Mounts and Vehicles

Mounts and land vehicles provide convenient means of travelling with heavy loads, but they become inconvenient when characters are travelling wild.

### Terrain Restrictions

Mounts and land vehicles can travel freely along roads and tracks, but travelling wild is limited by certain terrain types. The Terrain Types table lists which types of terrain mounts and vehicles may enter, with mounts only able to be led (i.e. not ridden) in certain types of terrain.

## Resting

Characters must rest for 1 day per week of travel (i.e. 6 days of travel, 1 day of rest) or become exhausted.

## Searching Hexes

Some hexes on the Ouran campaign map contain hidden features which stay unnoticed by a party simply wandering through the area. Hidden features can be found by searching a hex, requiring extra time and Travel Points.

**Travel Point cost:** The Terrain Types table lists the cost to search a hex, based on its terrain type.

**Hidden features:** Searching may reveal hidden features in a hex, if any are present. Once a hidden feature has been located, it can be found again without searching.

## Losing Direction

**Checks:** One roll for getting lost is made each day. The Referee makes this roll at the start of the travel day. If the party is travelling along a road (no chance of getting lost), the roll for getting lost is made when they leave the road.

**Travelling wild:** The chance of getting lost depends on the terrain being explored—see the Terrain Types table.

**Following a road:** There is no chance of getting lost. 

**Following a track:** There is a 1-in-6 chance of getting lost. 

**Visibility:** In conditions of reduced visibility, such as fog or blizzards, the chance of getting lost increases by 1 (e.g. 2-in-6 becomes 3-in-6), and in darkness by 2.


## Wandering Monsters

See [[Hazards and Challenges#Wandering Monsters]] for more information.

**Checks:** One check for wandering monsters is made each day. The Referee may make this roll either at the start of the day, halfway through the day (when the party has spent half its Travel Points), or at the end of the day.

**Chance:** The chance of an encounter depends on the type of terrain being traversed—see the Terrain Types table.

**Creature:** The Ouran Campaign Book includes tables to determine the type of creatures encountered.

**Distance:** Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 30′ away. If both sides are surprised (see [[Encounters]]), this is reduced to 1d4 × 30′.


Basic Overview:
The world is a megadungeon, each hex a room, stock accordingly.
3 mile hexes
You can travel/explore overland for 8 hours.
1 hour per hex to LEAVE through any face.
Harder terrains like hills and forests take 2 hours to leave. Jungle, swamp, mountain etc. Take 3. (This makes hexes "sticky". It's easy to leave town for the Deep dark woods. It's harder to leave the Deep dark woods.
Leaving a hex via a face with a road or trail is always Easy (1 hour) instead of the hex cost.
Rivers add an hour to cross unless there is a bridge or Ford (road or path crossing)
Conditions like any type of exhaustion or heavy encumbrance adds an hour to each hex cost.
Fully mounted parties can subtract 1 hour once per day (unless they get fresh horses).
Obvious things are revealed when the party enters a hex. Hidden or secret things have to be explored for (takes same time cost as to leave the hex).
Terrain decides how many hexes you can see the terrain of around you. Usually one hex out unless heavy forest (0) or mountains (2) etc.
For wandering monsters checks, every other Dungeon turn in dungeons, every other Hour during travel, every other Watch while camping or resting, and every other day in Safe Havens. (Or you can use a tension pool at similar intervals which is what I personally do).
Moves fast, easy to remember, easy for players to intuit, covers most things I care to, and the sticky hexes act as fly traps instead of walls blocking tough hexes from being entered.
