# Somatophylax

  * **Hit Points:** 1d8 per Level, +2 after Level 10
  * **Combat Aptitude:** Martial
  * **Armour:** Light and Medium, shields
  * **Weapons:** Any weapons

Somatophylakes are masters of combat and, as vassals of nobility, hold a special rank in society. Somatophylakes earn great respect from the common folk and exemplify the qualities of nobility, honour, and decency in all their deeds. Player Character somatophylakes are typically wandering the land in pursuit of adventure to prove themselves.

### Servant 

A somatophylax serves one of the imperial houses. The player should roll or choose one of the houses listed under The Imperial Houses.

**Disfavour:** An appointment may be revoked if a somatophylax displeases or dishonours their liege through failure, rebellion, Alignment change, or unbecoming conduct. In this case, the character becomes a fighter of equivalent Level. It may be possible to regain the house’s favour (and thus the status of somatophylax) by performing a special quest.

### Restrictions

**Alignment:** A somatophylax must have the same Alignment as their liege.

**Social class:** Somatophylakes are often members of the noble classes, but a person of lowlier origin may be appointed as a somatophylax as a reward for noble deeds.

**Weapons:** Somatophylakes can use all melee weapons.

**Armour:** Somatophylakes regard armour as a symbol of prowess and status, always favouring the most impressive and intimidating-looking armour available. They scorn Heavy armour as suitable only for the unskilled.

#### Starting Equipment 

**Armour (roll 1d6):** 1. Triple-disc cuirass. 2–3. Muscle cuirass + shield. 4. Muscle cuirass with manica & greaves. 5–6. Triple-disc cuirass with manica & greaves + shield.

**Weapons (roll 1d6 twice):** 1. Sling. 2–4. Spatha. 5. Spear. 6. Khopesh.

### Somatophylax Code 

Somatophylakes strive to uphold a stringent code of honour which binds all decision and deed. See The Somatophylax Code. The repercussions of performing acts at odds with the somatophylax code depend on the Alignment of the somatophylax and their liege.

**Lawful or Neutral:** The somatophylax brings dishonour upon their liege, thus risking Disfavour.

**Chaotic:** The somatophylax is unlikely to bring dishonour upon their liege, whose reputation is already villainous. Unchivalrous deeds are, however, perceived as besmirching the institution of scholae somatophylax. Other somatophylax hunt the Chaotic somatophylax and attempt to bring them to justice.

#### The Somatophylax Code 

**Honour:** A somatophylax must behave honourably in all deeds. A somatophylax's honour is of utmost importance. Death is preferable to dishonour.

**Service:** Service to one’s liege is the greatest honour.

**Glory:** A somatophylax must seek glory in battle—especially in single combat.

**Protecting the weak:** Any person in the somatophylax's charge must be defended to the death.

**Hierarchy:** The hierarchy that binds society is to be upheld. Superiors must be honoured, equals respected, inferiors commanded, and the ignoble scorned.


##### Somatophylax Status 
Somatophylakes of Levels 1–2 are known as a phylax and are not yet regarded as true a somatophylax. They receive a feather mantle from their master when they are accepted. Upon reaching Level 3, the character is appointed by their liege and gains the right to bear a coat of arms, typically emblazoned upon the somatophylax's shield or lower disc.

**Hospitality:** Once appointed, the character earns rights of hospitality and aid from nobles and other somatophylax of the same Alignment. Hospitality extends to any companions the somatophylax is willing to vouch for. The somatophylax is expected to extend such hospitality in kind.

### Somatophylax Skills

Retrying: The somatophylax may only attempt to read the same document again after gaining a Level.
#### Alertness
If a somatophylax's party is surprised, the phylax may make an Alertness Check to act normally in the Surprise Round. See Surprise.

When able to tumble, phylakes suffer no damage from the first 10' fallen.
