Clerics are members of an order of holy warriors sworn to the service of the Pluritine Church. They are organised in a strict religious hierarchy, under the command of higher-ranking Church officials. Player Character clerics are typically granted a writ of self-determination, allowing them to roam freely and carry out the will of God as they see fit.

==== Restrictions ====

**Alignment:** As servants of the Church, clerics must be Lawful or Neutral.

**Falling from grace:** Clerics must be faithful to the tenets of their order (see Cleric Tenets). A cleric who transgresses or becomes Chaotic falls from grace and loses the ability to pray for spells. The Referee may allow the character to perform a quest of atonement in order to regain favour.

**Kindred:** Only mortals are trained as clerics—fairies and demi-fey have no spiritual connection with the deities of mortals.

**Magic armaments:** Clerics are forbidden to use magic weapons, armour, and shields of arcane or fairy origin. They may only use holy magic armaments.

==== Starting Equipment ====

**Armour (roll 1d6):** 1. Leather. 2. Leather + shield. 3. Chainmail. 4. Chainmail + shield. 5. Plate mail. 6. Plate mail + shield.

**Weapons (roll 1d6 twice):** 1. Dagger. 2. Longsword. 3. Mace. 4. Shortbow + 20 arrows. 5. Shortsword. 6. Warhammer.

**Class items:** Wooden holy symbol.

===== Cleric Tenets =====

**Evangelism:** Non-believers are to be brought into the fold and converted.

**Hierarchy:** The hierarchy of the Church is to be upheld. Those of lesser rank must obey their superiors.

**Monotheism:** Only One True God exists, and His name is ineffable. Other religions worship personifications of divine aspects of God or the anointed saints.

**Sanctity of life:** Sentient life is sacred. Clerics must protect the innocent with all means available.

===== Detect Holy Magic Items =====

A cleric can detect whether an item is enchanted with holy magic.

**Requirements:** The cleric must touch the object and concentrate without distraction.

**Time:** Detecting holy magic takes 1 Turn.

===== Holy Magic =====

See [[Holy Magic]] for full details on holy magic, including praying for spells and the list of spells that clerics can cast.

**Holy symbol:** A cleric must carry a holy symbol (see [[Adventuring Gear]]).

**Spell casting:** Once a cleric has proven their devotion (from Level 2), the character may pray to the host of saints to receive their blessings in the form of holy spells. The Cleric Spells Per Day table shows the number of spells a cleric may receive, determined by the character’s Level. For example, a Level 3 cleric may have the blessing to cast at most two Rank 1 spells.

**Using magic items:** Clerics can use magic items exclusive to holy spell-casters (for example, magic rods or scrolls of holy spells).

===== Holy Order =====

Upon reaching Level 2, a cleric is initiated into one of the following holy orders, selected by the player. Clerics of each order gain a special power and bear the order’s holy symbol.

==== The Order of St Faxis ====

The order of seekers; clerics who follow an edict to root out practitioners of dark magic—those who truck with devils or deal in necromancy.

**Arcane antipathy:** A cleric of St Faxis gains a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against arcane magic. Arcane spell-casters suffer a –2 penalty to Saving Throws against spells cast by a cleric of St Faxis.

**Holy symbol:** Three crossed swords.

==== The Order of St Sedge ====

The defenders of the Church; clerics who protect the lands of the Church from invaders.

**Laying on hands:** A cleric of St Sedge can heal by laying their hands on wounded characters. Once a day, the cleric can heal a total of up to 1 Hit Point per Level.

**Holy symbol:** A hand with two fingers raised.

==== The Order of St Signis ====

The order of Lichwards; clerics who watch over the dead and hunt those which rise again as undead.

**Undead slayer:** A cleric of St Signis gains a +1 Attack bonus against undead monsters. Their attacks harm undead monsters that can normally only be harmed by magical or silver weapons, even when not wielding a weapon of the appropriate type.

**Holy symbol:** A human skull crowned with ivy.

===== Languages =====

In addition to their native languages, clerics speak Liturgic, the language of Church scripture.

===== Turning the Undead =====

A cleric may attempt to drive off undead monsters by presenting their holy symbol and invoking the might of the One True God.

**Range:** The undead must be within 30′. Concealed undead (e.g. behind doors or in coffers) are unaffected.

**Turning roll:** When a cleric attempts to turn the undead, roll 2d6 to determine the result (modifiers listed below):
  * **4 or lower:** The undead are unaffected.
  * **5–6:** 2d4 undead are stunned for 1 Round, unable to act.
  * **7–12:** 2d4 undead flee from the cleric for 1 Turn.
  * **13 or higher:** 2d4 undead are permanently destroyed.

**Lower Level undead:** If the undead are lower Level than the cleric, the turning roll is modified by +2 per Level difference (maximum +6). For example, a Level 5 cleric turning Level 3 undead would gain a +4 bonus.

**Higher Level undead:** If the undead are higher Level than the cleric, the turning roll is modified by –2 per Level difference (maximum –6). For example, a Level 3 cleric turning Level 6 undead would suffer a –6 penalty.

**Mixed groups:** In encounters with multiple types of undead, those of lowest Level are affected first. On a successful turning roll, the cleric may make another roll the following Round, affecting the next lowest Level type of undead present. This process may be repeated until all types of undead have been affected or a turning roll fails.

**Usage frequency:** One attempt per Turn.
