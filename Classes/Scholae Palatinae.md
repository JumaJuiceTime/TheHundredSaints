====== Palatinae ======

  * **Prime Abilities:** Charisma and Strength
  * **Hit Points:** 1d8 per Level, +2 after Level 10
  * **Combat Aptitude:** Martial
  * **Armour:** Medium and Heavy, shields
  * **Weapons:** Any melee weapons

Scholae Palatinae are masters of heavily armoured, mounted combat and, as vassals of nobility, hold a special rank in society. Palatinae earn great respect from the common folk and exemplify the qualities of nobility, honour, and decency in all their deeds. Player Character palatinae are typically palatinae-errant those who wander the land in pursuit of adventure to prove their chivalric virtues.

==== Liege ====

A palatinae serves one of the noble houses. The player should roll or choose one of the houses listed under The Noble Houses.

**Disfavour:** An appointment may be revoked if a palatinae displeases or dishonours their liege through failure, rebellion, Alignment change, or non-chivalric conduct. In this case, the character becomes a fighter of equivalent Level. It may be possible to regain the liege’s favour (and thus the status of palatinae) by performing a special quest.

==== Restrictions ====

**Alignment:** A palatinae must have the same Alignment as their liege.

**Social class:** Palatinae are often members of the noble classes, but a person of lowlier origin may be appointed as a palatinae as a reward for noble deeds.

**Weapons:** Palatinae can use all melee weapons (preferring the lance) but cannot use missile weapons, which they regard as dishonourable.

**Armour:** Palatinae regard armour as a symbol of prowess and status, always favouring the most impressive and impervious-looking armour available. They scorn Light armour as suitable only for peasants and villains.

==== Starting Equipment ====

**Armour (roll 1d6):** 1. Lamellar with pteruges. 2–3. Lamellar with pteruges + shield. 4. Lamellar panoply. 5–6. Lamellar panoply + shield.

**Weapons (roll 1d6 twice):** 1. Dagger. 2–4. Lance (spear for Small characters). 5. Spatha. 6. Mace.

===== Palatine Code =====

Palatinae strive to uphold a stringent code of honour which binds all decision and deed. See The Palatine Code. The repercussions of performing acts at odds with the palatine code depend on the Alignment of the palatinae and their liege.

**Lawful or Neutral:** The Palatinae brings dishonour upon their liege, thus risking Disfavour.

**Chaotic:** The Palatinae is unlikely to bring dishonour upon their liege, whose reputation is already villainous. Unchivalrous deeds are, however, perceived as besmirching the institution of scholae palatinae. Other palatinae hunt the Chaotic palatinae and attempt to bring them to justice.

==== The Palatine Code ====

**Honour:** A palatinae must behave honourably in all deeds. A palatinae's honour is of utmost importance. Death is preferable to dishonour.

**Service:** Service to one’s liege is the greatest honour.

**Glory:** A palatinae must seek glory in battle—especially in single combat.

**Protecting the weak:** Any person in the palatinae's charge must be defended to the death.

**Hierarchy:** The hierarchy that binds society is to be upheld. Superiors must be honoured, equals respected, inferiors commanded, and the ignoble scorned.

===== Horsemanship =====

**Assessing steeds:** Palatinae are expert riders and can assess the worth of any steed. This allows a palatinae to determine whether an animal has low, average, or high Hit Points for its type.

**Urging great speed:** From Level 5, a palatinae can urge their steed to great haste once a day, increasing its Speed by 10 for up to 6 Turns.

===== Palatine Status =====

Palatinae of Levels 1–2 are known as Scholarioi or Schola and are not yet regarded as true Scholae Palatinae. Upon reaching Level 3, the character is appointed by their liege and gains the right to bear a coat of arms, typically emblazoned upon the palatinae's shield.

**Hospitality:** Once appointed, the character earns rights of hospitality and aid from nobles and other palatinae of the same Alignment. Hospitality extends to any companions the palatinae is willing to vouch for. The palatinae is expected to extend such hospitality in kind.

===== Monster Slayer =====

From Level 5, a palatinae gains a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls against Large creatures.

===== Katophractos =====

Palatinae gain a +1 Attack bonus when mounted.

===== Strength of Will =====

Palatinae gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against magic and effects that cause fear.
