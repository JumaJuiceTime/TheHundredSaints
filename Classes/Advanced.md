## Warrior Attacks per Round

| Warrior Level | Attacks per Round |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1–6           | 1/round           |
| 7–12          | 3/2 rounds        |
| 13+           | 2/round           |

Weapons: All
Armor: All + shields

## Lord: At 9th level, a fighter becomes a “Lord” or gains some other special title. A lord’s reputation is enough that they’re entitled to land or the right to build a stronghold. With a stronghold,
a lord attracts a small army of men-at-arms as well as an elite guard that enforce his rule. While the loyalty of these troops is greater than the average hireling, the lord is still expected to pay their wages and treat them fairly.

The GM is in charge of assigning the lord’s men. A good rule of thumb is one leader half the lord’s level, eighty 0-level soldiers (pike men, archers, and mace men), and an elite guard of twelve 1st level knights.



## Paladin Kit
Detect Evil: Paladins can cast a detect evil with a 60’ range by concentrating for 1 round. They can only detect evil monsters and characters, not magic.

Divine Grace: Paladins receive a +2 bonus on all saving throws.

Divine Health: Paladins are immune to all diseases but not curses such as lycanthropy.

Lay on Hands: Paladins can heal by the laying on of hands. 1/day, a paladin can heal 2 HP per experience level on himself or someone else.

Cure Disease: Paladins can cast cure disease once per week per 5 experience levels.

Aura of Protection: Paladins emit an aura of protection in a 10’ radius. All summoned and evil creatures suffer a −1 penalty to
attack rolls within the aura.

Circle of Power: A paladin wielding a holy sword projects power in a 15’ radius when the sword is unsheathed and wielded. This ability dispels enemy magic up to the experience level of the paladin.

Turn Undead: A paladin can turn undead, devils, and demons at 3rd level as if he were a 1st level cleric. The paladin’s turning level increases to 2nd at 4th level, 3rd at 5th, etc.



## Ranger Kit

Favored Enemy: At any point before 2nd level, rangers choose a species of creature that represents their chosen enemy. Typical creatures include those native to the ranger’s homeland and are
found in natural settings, such as giants, gnolls, goblins, and undead (GM has final say). The ranger gains a +4 bonus to attack rolls against his favored enemy. His hatred is hard to mask resulting in a -4 penalty to reaction rolls against the favored enemy.
The ranger will always attack his favored enemy first in combat unless another creature presents a greater threat.

Animal Empathy: Rangers can calm and befriend domesticated animals instantly. Wild animals must roll a saving throw vs. rods to resist a ranger’s effect. The ranger imposes a −1 penalty to this saving throw and an additional −1 for every 3 levels (-2 at 3rd , −3 at 6th, etc.). If the animal fails, the ranger can shift its reaction one category as he chooses.

# PRIEST
The priest is a holy man devoted to a tenet, faith, idea, or philosophy. Through his staunch belief, he draws powerful divine energy and channels it into miracles. Priests can be charitable
worshipers of a good deity, warmongers that bless troops and curse enemies, or vile believers of diabolic lords. Priests cast spells from 16 spheres of influence: All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental,
Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather. No priest can cast spells from every sphere. Priests are considered to have major, minor or no access to a sphere. Major access is unrestricted and minor access is restricted
to spell levels 1st through 3rd
.
Priests receive spells through prayer to their deity or reflection on their beliefs. If a priest abandons his deity or belief he can no longer cast spells. Priests can convert to different deities or beliefs, but the GM must determine the exact methods.
Clerics represent a generic member of a clergy. The druid is an example of a specialized priest with specific tenants and abilities.

# CLERIC
The cleric is the most common priest. Whether he works through a church or in the field, a cleric casts divine magic through prayer and faith. Their holy symbol is their most important object, often used as a spell component and necessary for turning the undead,
therefore, clerics start the game with a simple wooden holy symbol. Clerics can be revered, respected, or feared for their powers. Clerics can be found among even the poorest villages or remote

Spheres of Influence: Clerics have minor access to the Elemental sphere and major access to spells from all other spheres of influence except Plant, Animal, and Weather.

Turn Undead: Clerics can exert divine power against the undead. Once per encounter, a cleric can turn undead, forcing them to run from his presence or even utterly destroy them. Rules for
turning appear in the combat chapter. 
Followers: At 8th level, a cleric who has built a place of worship attracts loyal followers. These followers, decided by the GM, are fanatically devoted to the cleric and remain with him without
pay so long as they’re treated fairly. These followers are typically 20d10 0-level soldiers that will seek the cleric’s guidance and blessing.

Stronghold: At 9th level, a cleric can construct a religious stronghold devoted to his faith or belief. The labor is made up of volunteers of his faith and the site is immune to taxes (assuming a civilization that respects his religion), making it 50% cheaper to
build than a normal stronghold.



# DRUID
Druids are wardens of nature. They revere nature, protect her, and unleash her fury against those that cause her undue harm. Because of their world outlook, druids are neutral. They believe everything in the world has its place, good and evil, and that all things come to an end regardless. A druid prefers good over evil, as evil creatures tend to harm nature, but a druid would be more likely to harass poachers than drive off a band of evil giants minding their own business.

Weapons: Clubs, sickles, darts, spears, daggers, scimitars, slings, and staves.

Armor: Leather and padded armor plus wooden shields.

## Spheres of Influence: Druids have major access to the All, Animal, Elemental, Healing, Plant, and Weather spheres of influence.

## Elemental Resistance: Druids gain a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire and electrical attacks.

## Druidic Language: All druids speak a secret language. They can only converse about nature or natural events. Non-druids can never comprehend this language and all druids jealously guard it.

## Detect Nature: At 3rd level, druids can identify and discern details of plants, animals, and water.

## Woodland Stride: At 3rd level, druids can pass through natural overgrown areas without hindrance or damage.

## Speak to Woodland Creatures: At 3rd level, druids learn to speak to creatures that live in forests, including centaurs, dryads, elves, fauns, gnomes, dragons, giants, lizard men, manticores, nixies, pixies, sprites, and treants. A druid can only choose one specific creature to communicate with. At every level above 3rd, the druid can select another woodland creature to speak with.

## Charm Immunity: At 7th level, druids are immune to charm spells cast by woodland creatures (dryads, nixies, nymphs, etc.).

## Wild Shape: At 7th level, druids can shape change into a reptile, bird, or mammal, three times per day. Each individual animal form can only be assumed once per day. The animal can be as small as a bird or as large as a bear. The druid heals 1d6 × 10%
of his current damage when he changes. The druid assumes all the characteristics of the new form but retains his mental ability scores (intelligence, wisdom, charisma). The druid’s clothing or armor and one item held in each hand meld into his new form, but the druid gains no special powers if the items are magical.
Excess items must either be removed in the case of larger forms or are discarded if changed into a smaller form.

Weapons: Clubs, daggers, darts, hand crossbows, knives, lassos, short bows, slings, broad swords, long swords, short swords,
staves.
Armor: Leather, studded leather, padded leather, elven chain
armor. Thieves suffer penalties to their abilities based on their
armor.

## Thieving Skills: Thieves are trained in special skills. At level 1, all thieves receive 60 points to add to their skills. No more than
30 points can be added to a single skill. At each level, the thief gains an additional 30 points, and no single skill can be raised by
more than 15 points. No skill can be raised above 95% including adjustments for dexterity, race, and armor. If a skill is ever
reduced below 1% it cannot be used at all.

Thieves and Ability Checks: While anyone can use an ability check to perform an action, thief skills are special, representing
years of training and experience. When a thief performs a skill, he keeps a successful result until conditions arise that would negatively affect him. For example, a thief hiding in shadows will
continue to do so until someone passes a lantern over his position. Thieves can also roll ability checks to effectively emulate
their class skills but doing so applies the normal restrictions.

## Pick Pockets: Thieves can snatch small items from pockets, palm unattended objects, and perform simple sleight of hand
tricks. Failure means the thief does not get the item, but does not determine whether the attempt was detected. To determine
detection, multiply the victim’s level or hit dice by three and subtract it from 100. If the thief’s roll was equal to or greater than the
difference, the thief is detected. It’s possible to pick pockets and be noticed at the same time.

## Open Locks: Thieves can pick any mechanical locking mechanism requiring keys and/or finesse to unlock. Picking a lock takes 1d10 rounds. Failure indicates the attempt is impossible until the thief increases in experience level. Picking locks requires
suitable tools. Improvised tools and stressful or awkward positions apply penalties as set by the GM.

## Find/Remove Traps: Thieves are trained in finding and disarming small traps. Any small mechanical trap, whether natural or artificially made, can be found and disarmed by the thief. Large
traps, such as pitfalls, or traps without accessible mechanics, such as a sliding wall, cannot be found or disarmed using this skill.

To find traps, the thief must visually inspect and touch the object or area containing the trap. The GM rolls this check in secret to keep the thief from making assumptions about his skill.
Thieves can inspect a single object or 10x10 foot space (walls, floors, and large constructions) once per experience level. Searching for a trap takes 1d10 rounds.
Found traps can be removed or disarmed requiring 1d10 rounds. On a success the trap is disarmed or removed. A failure indicates the trap is too advanced and the thief can try again
after gaining a level in thief. On a dice roll of 96–100 the trap is automatically sprung. Removing or disarming a trap requires suitable tools. Improvised tools and stressful or awkward positions apply penalties as set by the GM.
Thieves can detect and remove magical traps, but the chance of success is halved.

## Move Stealthily: Thieves can attempt to move stealthily at will by reducing their movement value to 1⁄3 normal. If successful, the thief increases his chance of surprising an enemy, avoiding detection, and setting up a backstab opportunity. The GM rolls this check secretly as the thief always believes he is moving as
stealthily as possible. A sneaking thief will do what he can to avoid detection (steer clear of squeaky boards, avoid casting shadows, walk on softer surfaces, time movements to coincide with background noises, maintain distance from guards, etc.). One Move Stealthily check is used for a given situation until conditions change. For example, if the thief walks into a room with
a different kind of floor, lighting or noises, he must roll a new check.

## Hide in Shadows: Thieves can attempt to vanish into concealment such as shadows, bushes, curtains, nooks, etc. A thief can
only hide when no one is observing him. He cannot move without rolling another check but may perform small motions like signaling or drawing items. Distractions, such as a creature caught
in a fight, may allow the thief to hide. The GM rolls the hide check in secret; thieves always believe they’re hiding properly. Infravision or special sight does not reveal a hidden thief.
Spells or abilities such as detect invisibility reveal a hidden thief. 

## Detect Noise: A thief can concentrate for one round to listen for minute sounds. A thief must remove any item covering his head
to use this ability. Sounds heard through thick barriers like walls or doors are unclear or garbled.

## Climb Walls: Thieves are expert climbers and can climb surfaces, including completely smooth or flat walls, without special gear. Thieves cannot fight or defend themselves while climbing.
Refer to Climbing and Climb Speed for more information.

## Read Languages: At 4th level, thieves can attempt to decipher the meaning of any written language. Thieves do not have to make a check for a language they know how to read. The check to read a language is rolled every time the thief tries to read a document written in an unknown language. The entire document (exact size determined by the GM) is checked only once. The check
is equal to how much the thief understands; a thief that rolls a 50% understands approximately half of what he is reading. Each separate document, even in the same language, requires a new check. If the thief fails he cannot try again on the same document
until he gains a level in thief.

## Backstab: Thieves are experts in attacking an enemy’s weak points. When attacking a surprised enemy’s flank or rear, he gains a +4 bonus to his attack and ignores his opponent’s dexterity and shield bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the thief
multiplies his weapon damage (before modifiers like strength are applied) by his backstab multiplier. Enemies must be unaware of the thief. If an enemy sees or hears the thief this skill cannot be used. Backstabbing can only
be done against living enemies with a discernible anatomy, excluding plants, undead, and constructs from being backstabbed.

### Backstab Damage Multipliers

| Thief's Level | Damage Multiplier |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1–4           | ×2                |
| 5–8           | ×3                |
| 9–12          | ×4                |
| 13+           | ×5                |

## Thieves’ Cant: Thieves have a special language used to communicate with each other. Thieves’ cant isn’t an actual language but disguised words, body language, and misleading statements
that can be worked into any language. Thieves’ cant is limited to subjects pertaining to thieves; hideouts, stolen goods, contacts,
black marketers, etc. Only thieves speaking the same language can use thieves’ cant to communicate.

## Use Scrolls: At 10th level, thieves can use magical and clerical scrolls. There is a 25% chance the attempt misfires, causing the spell to be centered on the thief or cast on a random target. The GM should choose a scenario that disadvantages the thief and/or his party.

## Stronghold: Thieves build a den at 10th level. Thieves’ dens tend to be fronts for illicit or questionable activity regardless of alignment. A good thief den could be a spy ring monitoring criminals while a dishonorable thief could use his den to fence stolen
goods. Thieves then attract a gang of followers appropriate to their alignment. These men are generally loyal, but not particularly devoted.

Thieves tend to be territorial and jealous of other powerful thieves. If another thief builds a den in the area, the two gangs usually battle, either openly or through subterfuge, until one overcomes the other. Even good thieves are suspicious of each other. While opposing thief’s dens of good alignment won’t resort to violence or cruel sabotage, there will always be a competitive rivalry involved. If a good thief’s den is disbanded, the next closest good-aligned den quickly absorbs it. In contrast, evil thieves seek the destruction of their weakened rivals, so that they may never rise again.
