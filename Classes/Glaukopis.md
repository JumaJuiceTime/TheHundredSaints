Glaukopis are masters of combat and, as vassals of nobility, hold a special rank in society. Glaukopis earn great respect from the common folk and exemplify the qualities of nobility, honour, and decency in all their deeds. Player Character glaukopis are typically wandering the land in pursuit of adventure to prove themselves.

==== Servant ====

A glaukopis serves one of the imperial houses. The player should roll or choose one of the houses listed under The Imperial Houses.

**Disfavour:** An appointment may be revoked if a glaukopis displeases or dishonours their liege through failure, rebellion, Alignment change, or non-chivalric conduct. In this case, the character becomes a fighter of equivalent Level. It may be possible to regain the liege’s favour (and thus the status of glaukopis) by performing a special quest.

==== Restrictions ====

**Alignment:** A glaukopis must have the same Alignment as their liege.

**Social class:** Glaukopis are often members of the noble classes, but a person of lowlier origin may be appointed as a glaukopis as a reward for noble deeds.

**Weapons:** Glaukopis can use all melee weapons.

**Armour:** Glaukopis regard armour as a symbol of prowess and status, always favouring the most impressive and intimidating-looking armour available. They scorn Heavy armour as suitable only for the unskilled.

==== Starting Equipment ====

**Armour (roll 1d6):** 1. Triple-disc cuirass. 2–3. Triple-disc cuirass + shield. 4. Triple-disc cuirass with manica & greaves. 5–6. Triple-disc cuirass with manica & greaves + shield.

**Weapons (roll 1d6 twice):** 1. Sling. 2–4. Spatha. 5. Spear. 6. Khopesh.

===== Glaukopis Code =====

Glaukopis strive to uphold a stringent code of honour which binds all decision and deed. See The glaukopis Code. The repercussions of performing acts at odds with the glaukopis code depend on the Alignment of the glaukopis and their liege.

**Lawful or Neutral:** The glaukopis brings dishonour upon their liege, thus risking Disfavour.

**Chaotic:** The glaukopis is unlikely to bring dishonour upon their liege, whose reputation is already villainous. Unchivalrous deeds are, however, perceived as besmirching the institution of scholae glaukopis. Other glaukopis hunt the Chaotic glaukopis and attempt to bring them to justice.

==== The glaux Code ====

**Honour:** A glaukopis must behave honourably in all deeds. A glaukopis's honour is of utmost importance. Death is preferable to dishonour.

**Service:** Service to one’s liege is the greatest honour.

**Glory:** A glaukopis must seek glory in battle—especially in single combat.

**Protecting the weak:** Any person in the glaukopis's charge must be defended to the death.

**Hierarchy:** The hierarchy that binds society is to be upheld. Superiors must be honoured, equals respected, inferiors commanded, and the ignoble scorned.


===== Glaukopis Status =====
Glaukopis of Levels 1–2 are known as Probatus and are not yet regarded as true a glaukopis. They receive a feather mantle from their master when they are accepted. Upon reaching Level 3, the character is appointed by their liege and gains the right to bear a coat of arms, typically emblazoned upon the glaukopis's shield.

**Hospitality:** Once appointed, the character earns rights of hospitality and aid from nobles and other glaukopis of the same Alignment. Hospitality extends to any companions the glaukopis is willing to vouch for. The glaukopis is expected to extend such hospitality in kind.

===== Monster Slayer =====

From Level 5, a glaukopis gains a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls against Large creatures.

===== Strength of Will =====

glaukopis gain a +2 bonus to Saving Throws against magic and effects that cause fear.
