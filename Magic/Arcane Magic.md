# Arcane Magic

Arcane spells take the form of patterns of magical energy imprinted into a character’s mind (a process known as memorising a spell). When a spell is cast, its pattern is erased from the character’s mind until it is memorised again.

## Spell Ranks

Spells are categorised by Rank, from Rank 1 (the least powerful) to Rank 6 (the most powerful). An arcane spell-caster’s Level determines which Rank of spells they are able to cast.

## Spell Books

Arcane spells are recorded in grimoires, treatises, tomes, and folios, collectively known as **spell books**. Arcane spell-casters collect and jealously hoard spell books, as these works of eldritch study are the primary source of their power.

**Languages:** Spell books may be written in common languages (e.g. Woldish, Old Woldish, Caprice, Drunic), in obscure or dead tongues, or occasionally in ciphers or magical script (using the [[Arcane Cypher]] spell).

## Learning Spells

There are several means by which an arcane spell-caster learns new spells, each described below.

**Spell Rank:** It is only possible to learn spells of a Rank the character can memorise, according to their Class and Level.

**Blank spell books:** Unless learning spells by studying from a spell book, learned spells must be written into a spell book (see [[Adventuring Gear]]). Up to three spells may be recorded in each spell book.

### Learning From a Mentor

If a character has an established relationship with an arcane spell-caster of at least 3 Levels higher, they may be able to consult with them to learn new spells. Learning a new spell from a mentor takes 1 week. The mentor usually expects a service in return, perhaps sending the character on a quest of some kind.

### Studying a Spell Book

As objects of great power, spell books are rarely found for sale, but they may be found in treasure hoards or stolen from rival spell-casters. To learn spells from a spell book, the character must be able to understand the written language (by dint of study or magic) and must spend time attempting to learn the spells it contains.

**Learning:** Learning a spell from a spell book requires 1 week of quiet study per Rank of the spell. The character must then make an Intelligence Check. If the check succeeds, they have learned the spell and may henceforth memorise it. If the check fails, the character may not try to learn this spell again before gaining a Level.

### Researching a New Spell

Spells may also be added to a spell book by a process of research, requiring 2 weeks and 1,000gp per Rank of the spell. Any arcane spell listed in this book may be researched. Players may also sometimes wish to invent entirely new spells. In this case, the Referee must read the proposed spell description, decide if the spell can be researched, and set a Rank for the spell.

**Chance of failure:** Spell research is not always fruitful. There is a minimum 1-in-6 chance of failure, in which case the invested time and money are lost.

## Lost Spell Books

In the event of disaster, an arcane spell-caster can rewrite spells they have learned into a blank spell book (see [[Adventuring Gear]]) by a process of research. This requires 1 week and 1,000gp per Rank of spell to be rewritten. For example, rewriting three Rank 1 spells and one Rank 2 spell would require 5 weeks and 5,000gp.

## Simple Spell Books (Optional Rule)

Groups wishing to avoid keeping track of collections of multiple spell books may rule instead that each caster maintains but a single book containing all the spells they have learned. In this case, all new spells learned are copied into the character’s spell book.

## Memorising Spells

An arcane spell-caster may memorise new spells once a day, imprinting the energy patterns of spells they have learned into their mind. Once memorised, a spell remains in the character’s mind until cast.

**Rest:** A character can only memorise spells following a night’s rest.

**Time:** Memorising spells requires 1 hour of quiet study.

**Spell books:** Spell books containing the spells to be memorised must be to hand.

**Number of spells:** The maximum number of spells an arcane spell-caster can imprint into their mind depends on their Class and Level.

**Duplicate spells:** Characters capable of memorising more than one spell of a given Rank may memorise multiple copies of the same spell.

## Casting Spells

A memorised spell is cast by precisely replicating a specific set of hand gestures and mystical words. When a spell is cast, the imprinted pattern of magical energy is erased from the caster’s mind until it is memorised again.

**Freedom:** The character must be able to speak and must have one hand free. An arcane spell-caster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.

**In combat:** Casting a spell counts as the character’s action in a Round, and the character may not move in the same Round as casting a spell. The intention to cast a spell must be declared before initiative is rolled. If the character is harmed before their initiative, the spell is disrupted (see [[Combat]]).

**Cumulative effects:** If multiple spells increasing the same statistic (e.g. bonuses to Attack, AC, damage, Saving Throws, etc.) are cast on a single subject, only the most powerful has effect.
