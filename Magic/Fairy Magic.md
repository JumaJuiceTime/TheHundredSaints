====== Fairy Magic ======

Fairy magic takes two forms—the glamours innate to folk touched by Fairy and the runes guarded by the fearsome fairy nobles.

**Cumulative effects:** If multiple spells (or runes or glamours) increasing the same statistic (e.g. bonuses to Attack, AC, damage, Saving Throws, etc.) are cast on a single subject, only the most powerful has effect.

===== Glamours =====

Glamours are innately possessed by natives of Fairy and by other folk touched by the magic that weaves throughout that world. Though mortals regard glamours as magic, for fairies they are as natural as breathing, speaking, or singing.

==== Learning Glamours ====

The number of glamours known by a character is determined by their Kindred, Class, and Level.

==== Using Glamours ====

Glamours are activated by thought alone, without the need for gesture or incantation, unless noted otherwise in a glamour’s description.

**Glamour usage frequency:** Unless noted otherwise in its description, there is no limit to the number of times a glamour may be used per day.

**In combat:** Using a glamour counts as the character’s action in a Round. The character may move in the same Round as using a glamour. The intention to use a glamour need not be declared before initiative is rolled, and glamours cannot be disrupted (see [[Combat]]).

===== Runes =====

The fairy runes are among the deepest magical secrets of fairy-kind. Discovered by mighty elf sorcerers in aeons long past, the runes tap into the magical fundament of Fairy itself. Their usage is thus governed by ancient and immutable laws of Fairy. Fairy nobles guard the knowledge of the runes, and only they may bestow their use upon individuals of lesser rank.

**Intangibility:** Runes are intangible; they are not physical objects and thus cannot be stolen, lost, or given to another.

**Magnitude:** Runes are divided into three levels of magnitude: lesser runes, greater runes, and mighty runes.

==== Learning Runes ====

The acquisition of runes is governed by the mercurial whims of the fairy nobles. Whenever a character (due to their Class) has the chance of acquiring a new rune, the player must roll 2d6 and consult the Rune Granted table.

**Level modifier:** Characters of Level 3–5 gain a +1 bonus to the 2d6 roll, characters of Level 6–9 gain a +2 bonus, and characters of Level 10 or above gain a +3 bonus.

**Other modifiers:** The Referee may optionally apply additional modifiers (bonuses or penalties, usually from –2 to +2) to the 2d6 roll, based on the character’s relationship with the fairy nobles. For example, a character who has thwarted an important scheme of a fairy noble may suffer a –2 penalty.

**Granted runes:** New runes are typically granted by means of a dream or vision in which the character visits the noble’s court.

**Duplicates:** If a rune is granted which the character already knows, the number of times it may be used is doubled.

**Quest:** At the Referee’s option, the fairy noble may require the character to perform some deed or quest in return for the granting of the rune.

==== Rune Granted ====

^ 2d6^ Rune Granted^
| 2 or less| Fickle displeasure—no rune|
| 3–7| 1 lesser rune (randomly selected)|
| 8–11| 1 greater rune (randomly selected)|
| 12 or more| 1 mighty rune (randomly selected)|

==== Quests in Fairy (Optional Rule) ====

If the Referee wishes, a character may be required to journey to a noble’s court in Fairy to receive a new rune, rather than receiving it in a dream or vision. This journey may be narrated as a downtime event between adventures or played out as a full adventure, depending on the preferences of the group.

**Entering Fairy:** The character receives a special invitation from a fairy noble, allowing entrance to Fairy for a short period via a special portal.

**Passing of time:** While the character journeys in Fairy, 2d20 days pass in the mortal world.

==== Using Runes ====

Runes are activated by thought alone, without the need for gesture or incantation, unless noted otherwise in a rune’s description.

**Rune usage frequency:** The magical laws governing the fairy runes place strict limits on the number of times a rune may be used. This depends on the magnitude of the rune (lesser, greater, or mighty) and the current Level of the character (i.e. not the character’s Level when the rune was granted). See the Rune Usage Frequency table.

**In combat:** Using a rune counts as the character’s action in a Round, and the character may not move in the same Round as using a rune. The intention to use a rune must be declared before initiative is rolled. If the character is harmed before their initiative, the rune is disrupted (see [[Combat]]).

==== Rune Usage Frequency ====

^ ^   Caster’s Current Level  ^^^
^ Type^ 1–4^ 5–9^ 10+^
| Lesser| Once per day| Twice per day| Thrice per day|
| Greater| Once per Level| Once per week| Once per day|
| Mighty| Once ever| Once ever| Once per year|

**Once per Level:** Once this rune is cast, the character may not cast it again until they have gained a Level.

**Once ever:** Once this rune is cast, the character may never cast it again unless it is once more granted by a fairy noble.
